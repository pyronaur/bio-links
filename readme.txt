With Bio Links plugin you can turn a single link into many.  (for example, in your Instagram Profile Bio). A helpful tool direct your visitors where they need to go.

== Description ==

Bio Links is a free plugin designed to help you organize your social media traffic. Create a landing page that holds all the content you wish to share with your followers. Send your followers to articles, website links, shops, social media and more.

## Why do I need this?

Most of the popular social media sites allow only a single URL in your bio page. Think Instagram, Twitter or Pinterest for example.
Let's say you have a personal website, a shop page, other social profiles and a cool new article. Because of the one link policy, you have to pick and choose which link to share on your bio page.

With Bio Links plugin you can create a simple landing page and house all your other links there. Now instead of you choosing where to lead your followers, each person can choose what they want to see next.

## How it works?

Bio Links will allow you to create as many link landing pages as you need. Each landing page will have its own unique address, profile picture, description and as many links as you need.


## Demo
You can also pick a design for each of your landing pages. Currently, you can choose from 4 design variations:

* [Default](http://biolinks.pyronaur.com/link/default)
* [Instagram Style](http://biolinks.pyronaur.com/link/instagram)
* [Dark](http://biolinks.pyronaur.com/link/dark)
* [Chic](http://biolinks.pyronaur.com/link/chic)

Bio Links plugin is optimized for speed, it won't load your theme files. The plugin will load its own styles and template files to maximize the performance of your landing pages!

Give it a try and send your followers to content that deserves their attention.
